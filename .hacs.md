# HACS Configuration Notes

This repository contains a **Home Assistant Custom Integration**, not a Lovelace card or plugin.

## Repository Structure

The integration code is located in:
```
custom_components/ha_atrea_recuperation/
```

## HACS Configuration

The `hacs.json` file is configured as follows:

- **`content_in_root: false`** - This is **REQUIRED** because the integration code is in a subdirectory (`custom_components/ha_atrea_recuperation/`), not in the repository root.
  
- **`filename: "custom_components/ha_atrea_recuperation/manifest.json"`** - Points to the manifest file that identifies this as a valid Home Assistant integration.

## Important Notes

### DO NOT change `content_in_root` to `true`

Setting `content_in_root: true` would cause HACS to:
- Install the entire repository root as the integration
- Include documentation, scripts, and other non-integration files in the user's `custom_components/` directory
- Break the integration completely

### This is NOT a Lovelace Card

This repository contains an **integration** (backend component), not a Lovelace card (frontend plugin). Therefore:
- There is NO `www/` directory (and there shouldn't be)
- There is NO `ha_atrea_recuperation_card.js` file
- Users install this via HACS → Integrations, not HACS → Frontend

### Correct Installation Path

When installed via HACS, the integration is copied to:
```
<config>/custom_components/ha_atrea_recuperation/
```

NOT to:
```
<config>/www/ha_atrea_recuperation_card/  ← This path is WRONG for integrations
```

## Verification

To verify HACS configuration is correct:

1. The repository must have `custom_components/ha_atrea_recuperation/manifest.json`
2. The `hacs.json` must have `content_in_root: false`
3. The `hacs.json` must have `filename` pointing to the manifest
4. There should be NO `www/` directory

## For Maintainers

- **NEVER** set `content_in_root: true` in this repository
- **NEVER** create a `www/` directory (this is not a card)
- **ALWAYS** keep integration code in `custom_components/ha_atrea_recuperation/`
- The root directory may contain: documentation, scripts, tests, and other development files

These files are NOT installed to users' Home Assistant instances.
